   *

     * YesTransfer means that the caller is transfering a reference count to
     * each of the cowns, so the schedule should remove a count if it is not
     * required.
     * @param body  The behaviour to schedule.
     *
     * @note
     *
     * To correctly implement the happens before order, we need to ensure that
     * one when cannot overtake another:
     *
     *   when (a, b, d) { B1 } || when (a, c, d) { B2 }
     *
     * Where we assume the underlying acquisition order is alphabetical.
     *
     * Let us assume B1 exchanges on `a` first, then we need to ensure that
     * B2 cannot acquire `d` before B1 as this would lead to a cycle.
     *
     * To achieve this we effectively do two phase locking.
     *
     * The first (acquire) phase performs exchange on each cown in same
     * global assumed order.  It can only move onto the next cown once the
     * previous behaviour on that cown specifies it has completed its scheduling
     * by marking itself ready, `set_ready`.
     *
     * The second (release) phase is simply making each slot ready, so that
     * subsequent behaviours can continue scheduling.
     *
     * Returning to our example earlier, if B1 exchanges on `a` first, then
     * B2 will have to wait for B1 to perform all its exchanges, and mark the
     * appropriate slot ready in phase two. Hence, it is not possible for any
     * number of behaviours to form a cycle.
     *
     *
     * Invariant: If the cown is part of a chain, then the scheduler holds an RC
     * on the cown. This means the first behaviour to access a cown will need to
     * perform an acquire. When the execution of a chain completes, then the
     * scheduler will release the RC.
