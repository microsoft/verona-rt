     * @param bodies  The behaviours to schedule.
     *
     * @param body_count The number of behaviours to schedule.
     *
     * @note
     *
     * *** Single behaviour scheduling ***
     *
     * To correctly implement the happens before order, we need to ensure that
     * one when cannot overtake another:
     *
     *   when (a, b, d) { B1 } || when (a, c, d) { B2 }
     *
     * Where we assume the underlying acquisition order is alphabetical.
     *
     * Let us assume B1 exchanges on `a` first, then we need to ensure that
     * B2 cannot acquire `d` before B1 as this would lead to a cycle.
     *
     * To achieve this we effectively do two phase locking.
     *
     * The first (acquire) phase performs exchange on each cown in same
     * global assumed order.  It can only move onto the next cown once the
     * previous behaviour on that cown specifies it has completed its scheduling
     * by marking itself ready, `set_ready`.
     *
     * The second (release) phase is simply making each slot ready, so that
     * subsequent behaviours can continue scheduling.
     *
     * Returning to our example earlier, if B1 exchanges on `a` first, then
     * B2 will have to wait for B1 to perform all its exchanges, and mark the
     * appropriate slot ready in phase two. Hence, it is not possible for any
     * number of behaviours to form a cycle.
     *
     *
     * Invariant: If the cown is part of a chain, then the scheduler holds an RC
     * on the cown. This means the first behaviour to access a cown will need to
     * perform an acquire. When the execution of a chain completes, then the
     * scheduler will release the RC.
     *
     * *** Extension to Many ***
     *
     * This code additional can schedule a group of behaviours atomically.
     *
     *   when (a) { B1 } + when (b) { B2 } + when (a, b) { B3 }
     *
     * This will cause the three behaviours to be scheduled in a single atomic
     * step using the two phase commit.  This means that no other behaviours can
     * access a between B1 and B3, and no other behaviours can access b between
     * B2 and B3.
     *
     * This extension is implemented by building a mapping from each request
     * to the sorted order of.  In this case that produces
     *
     *  0 -> 0, a
     *  1 -> 1, b
     *  2 -> 2, a
     *  3 -> 2, b
     *
     * which gets sorted to
     *
     *  0 -> 0, a
     *  1 -> 2, a
     *  2 -> 1, b
     *  3 -> 2, b
     *
     * We then link the (0,a) |-> (2,a), and enqueue the segment atomically onto
     * cown a, and then link (1,b) |-> (2,b) and enqueue the segment atomically
     * onto cown b.
     *
     * By enqueuing segments we ensure nothing can get in between the
     * behaviours.
     *
     * *** Duplicate Cowns ***
     *
     * The final complication the code must deal with is duplicate cowns.
     *
     * when (a, a) { B1 }
     *
     * To handle this we need to detect the duplicate cowns, and mark the slot
     * as not needing a successor.  This is done by setting the cown pointer to
     * nullptr.
     *
     * Consider the following complex example
     *
     * when (a) { ... } + when (a,a) { ... } + when (a) { ... }
     *
     * This will produce the following mapping
     *
     * 0 -> 0, a
     * 1 -> 1, a (0)
     * 2 -> 1, a (1)
     * 3 -> 2, a
     *
     * This is sorted already, so we can just link the segments
     *
     * (0,a) |-> (1, a (0)) |-> (2, a)
     *
     * and mark (a (1)) as not having a successor.
