/**
 * This benchmark is for testing performance of the work stealing code.
 *
 * A single behaviour generates all the work, which then needs dividing amongst
 * the scheduler threads.
 *
 * There are two types of work that are generated
 *   - nop: does nothing
 *   - work: schedules a an item on sync to count down to monitor the time taken
 *
 * Basic shape is
 *
 *   sync -> nop
 *        -> nop
 *        -> nop
 *        -> nop
 *        -> work -> sync
 *        ...
 *
 * The time taken to schedule all the work is measured.
 * The time taken to execute all the work is measured.
 *
 * The core aim is to generate a lot of work on a single scheduler thread to tax
 * the work stealing code.  As the main behaviour in test is long running,
 * stealing work items from the scheduler thread that runs it is essential.
 *
 * We generate a nop work so that not everything has to contend for the sync
 * cown to complete.
